# NumPy_Basic_Exercises
Here you can find some basic Numpy exercises to practice your NumPy skills and basic notes about the NumPy library.

I am learning about NumPy and i decided to unpload my exercises and notes to github, because this could be useful for someone who also wants to learn NumPy :)
